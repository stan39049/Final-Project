# Final-Project
Group Members: Stanley Huang
I achieved what I was aiming for during the planning stages. However, I came into a few diffuculties while working on the project. First of all, the project was done in C# sharp, a language that I have not worked with prior to making this. Additionally, Although the tutorial on how to create the game went through every step, it used an older version of the Unity engine which lead to some of the components and elements not being the same. I was also unfamiliar with using the Unity engine. As a result of all of this, I learned quite a bit about how to use the engine in the event that I use it in the future. I was also able to overcome the problems I faced with trial and error in which I would make small adjustments in the code until it worked for the version of Unity I was running.
